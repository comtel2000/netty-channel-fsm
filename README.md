# Netty Channel FSM
![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.digitalpetri.netty/netty-channel-fsm)

A `ChannelFsm` manages non-blocking access to a Netty `Channel` instance. 

Access to the Channel happens via `connect()`, `disconnect()`, and `getChannel()`. 

Once connected, the state machine works to keep the Channel connected until `disconnect()` is called. 

## Gradle
```
dependencies {
    compile("com.digitalpetri.netty:netty-channel-fsm:1.0.0")
}
```

## Maven
```
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.digitalpetri.netty</groupId>
      <artifactId>netty-channel-fsm</artifactId>
      <version>1.0.0</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### Persistence
When the `persistent` setting is `true`, if the initial `connect()` fails it will move into a reconnecting state rather than back to a not connected state.

### Lazyness
When the `lazy` settings is `true`, a connection loss moves the state machine into an idle state, waiting to reconnect until the next `connect()` or `getChannel()` call requests a Channel.
